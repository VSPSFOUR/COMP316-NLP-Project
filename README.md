## Extractive Summarization Section
### Notebooks
#### Extractive Summarization - 222003978 - COMP316.ipynb
  - Holds the Text-Rank algorithm used to extract a summary from original text.
  - All linked cell blocks are collected under a heading.
#### Evaluating Extractive Summarizer.ipynb
  - This notebook is utilised to gather metrics to evaluate the Text-Rank algorithm located in "Extractive Summarization - 222003978 - COMP316.ipynb".
  - These metrics are gathered by comparing a baseline summary to one created by the algorithm. This is done by the "find_similarity" function.
  - The follow headings separate the code:
    - "Code for Extractive Summarization" : holds the required Text-Rank functions.
    - "Confimation Test summarizer works" : used to test the algorithms.
    - "Methods for testing" : Contain all remaining functions and code used to evaluate the Text-Rank algorithm.
  - All metrics are stored in a CSV file.
### Data Sets
  - "TestSummarizer.zip" holds the data used for the evaluation.
